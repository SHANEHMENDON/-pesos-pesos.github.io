//Hey, I'm Shane H Mendon.I'm pursuing CS in PESU RR Campus, and I'm in second year now. I would like to join PESOS so that I could be more confident with coding and could get to learn more about how to code and how to be creative by being around the best. It would be great to be a part of PESOS club. Thanks.
